     <header> <h1>Mötley Crüe adapts The Dirt to film</h1></header>
     <img class="articlepic" src="../../pics/thedirt.jpg" alt="Motley Crue">
     
     <p>Mötley Crew have announced that their best-seller autobiography <i>The Dirt-Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band</i>
     will be adapted for the silver screen.Mötley Crüe have hired TV and movie-director Jeff Tremaine, who previously has directed such shows as Jackass, Nitro Circus
     and Wildboyz as well as all of the Jackass movies for the adapation of The Dirt. </p>
     
    <p> The book, which was released in 2001, was co-written by all four band-members and author Neil Strauss. It spent 4 weeks on the
     New York Bestselles list, and sold 13,000 copies in the UK. Neil Strauss has also co-authored Marilyn Mansons autobiography <i>The Long Hard Road Out of Hell</i>.
     
     
     <p>In an interview with Deadline.com, Tremaine says that his first attempt to score the gig, it was passed off as a joke. </p>
         
     <div id="qoute"><p> "I’ve wanted to make this going back to 2001, when we were just planning the first Jackass movie and I found out that David Gale at MTV Films had just optioned the book.
     First of all, I had no idea how to make Jackass into a movie, but I said to him, let me direct that movie, too. He said, yeah, of course! </p>
     <p>He was being sarcastic, because he had the same level of confidence in me as a director as I did at that time. 
     Luckily for me, the movie never got made, and when this project became available, I put everything I had into chasing it and convincing everyone
     that I am the right guy for it. I really feel I am.”</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Tremaine also pushes the importance of getting everyhing just right, but if you're hoping for a crazy and funny adaptation you might be out of luck.
        The director himself claims that the movie will be pretty dark, and will not be comedy.</p>
    
    
   
    <p>“It’s important to get actors who play, or who understand how to deliver the charisma it takes to be onstage.
    Rock stars have a swagger. Some of what they went through is funny, but overall this movie is not going to be a comedy. It’s pretty dark.
    <p>I think fans of what I’ve done will like this movie, but it’s not going to make you fall out of your chair laughing.”</p>
   
    
    <p>The script will also be polished by Californication-screenwriter and producer Tom Kapinos. The filming of the adaptation is planned for early next year.
