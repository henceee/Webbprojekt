     <header> <h1>Metallica admits to being 'Beliebers'</h1></header>
     <img class="articlepic" src="../../pics/ew.gif" alt="Metallica and Justin Bieber">
     <p> In an interview for <i>Q Magazine</i>, via Blabbermouth a series of subjects were discussed. Everything from the Black Album to Justin Bieber.
         When asked, if the thrashlegends Metallica were 'Beliebers', frontman James Hetfield shortly and simply replied 'yes.'</p>
    
   
    <p>This is not something out of a april-fools article, with the intention of tricking the readers. Just to clear out any misconceptions right from the start.
    Hetfield did, believe it or not, answer that he was a Belieber, without any sarcasm. His answer was fully supported
        by his fellow bandmembers. </p>
    
    <p>
        "I think the kid's really talented and obviously to go through what he's going through at that early age must be a mindf**k", said Lars Ulrich.
        "So the fact that he still goes out there and does it, I admire that and I think he's super talented, so I guess I am kind of a Belieber.”
    </p>
    
    
    <p> As long as he stays out of trouble, I'll be a Belieber", Robert Trujillo chimed in, but perhaps with a more careful approach.</p>
